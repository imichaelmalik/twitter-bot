# twitter-bot
This is a Twitter API bot made with Python3 Tweepy.


How to use:
If you have'nt done this before or don't have a developer account on Twitter, go to http://developer.twitter.com & login with your existing Twitter account.
Sign up for a developer account. It usually takes 2-3 days for confirmation. For ideal results, tell them that you don't intend to use Twitter data outside of Twitter, unless you do, lol.

After creating a Twitter Developer Account, go to http://apps.twitter.com & see your Project that you created. Go to settings & change app permissions to Read, Write & Direct Messages. Then go back to http://apps.twitter.com & click on the key button next to your project. Copy both API Key & Secret along with Access Token & Secret.

Come to the python file (open with any idle or just notepad)

Fill in consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token & access_token_secret. Fill it in single quotes. (Example- consumer_key = 'kdbfhsbd9gr873g9ghbr')
(API Key & Secret are your consumer_key & consumer_secret)

Imp!! Replace imichaelmalik with your twitter username (wherever in the file)

When you run the program, it asks you for either "follow" or "unfollow" in both of which cases it follows new users & unfollows the ones that don't follow you back respectively. If you run this too much, Twitter will change the API keys, so you will have an error.

To learn how to install Python3 (or TWEEPY) or run a python file from CMD/SHELL, please check youtube, it'll be too long to explain here.

Maybe also Follow me on Twitter, lol. Cheers.
